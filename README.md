**Infinite Campus API 2.0**

This project is aiming to fill create an Infinite Campus API and can be considered a successor to Sam Hocevar's (shinyquagsire23) Infinite Campus API.
This is written in Java and currently only printouts a student's grades to the console and into a generated grades.txt. 
The app authenticates and retrieves the data using the District Code used in the mobile Infinite Campus app and the student's username and password.

**Dependencies**

This project currently only requires a minimum of Java 1.7.
